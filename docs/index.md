# _Ignorance is a bliss_, but so is consistency

_Ignorance is a bliss_ is a classic quote from Matrix movie. Ignorance can truly bring blissful feelings, but so can consistency in programming.

My name is Ondrej Valenta, and this framework is how I lead my little soldiers through this battlefield we call (enterprise) programming, to survive and to find the bliss.
I'm doing corporate development since 2005, and I'm a programmer since 1997. I've encountered dozens of programmers and worked on dozens of projects, so this framework is not something that I just pulled out of my thumb, it is, and always was, a necessity for me ti stay sane and on top of things.

## Insanity called programming

Programming is not for the faint of heart. It's one of the most difficult jobs on this planet. Those who laugh at this claim have never really done programming.

The main cause of all our problems is the ever changing character of our environment. The technology you used today, you can forget tomorrow, the way you did something today, tomorrow will others claim as obsolete, as the old world approach.

The reality is you'll have to study, study, study, forget everything and study some more. The only thing that remains the same is you, and your coding practices.


## YOU MUST BE REPLACEABLE

One of the most important aspects of programming is to realize you must be replaceable, since you are replaceable. Everyone is, and that's ok, it's a good thing. It means you can also replace someone else.

We are a tiny [company](https://keenmate.com) and yet we have more than 200 repositories on GitHub. We've done so many different projects and proof-of-concepts over the years, that our replaceability is absolutely key element.

It's important to understand that if our nomenclature, our code structure, our approach to stuff is the same, we can easily jump from one project to another, we can easily help out others. We know exactly what to expect from the code, where to find things, how to name things so others understand them. 

This makes us very flexible, agile, it takes almost no time to switch projects.

If you are now thinking, but hey, I'm just a solo programmer, I don't need others to understand my code, then hear this. We have projects running 5, 10, even 15 years with almost zero changes in code, it's almost certain one day we'll have to come back to them and exactly then will be so happy we find the same code structure as we use today.

__Remember, you are also replaceable by your future self.__

You'll thank yourself later for having the same coding habbits.
