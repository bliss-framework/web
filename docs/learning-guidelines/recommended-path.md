# Our recommended learning path

The path of a new programmer is a difficult one. So much to learn, it's overwhelming. This is our curated list of what you should learn. It's how we teach our programmers.

!!! warning Remember

    Small portions of knowledge, don't go too deep, too soon. Eat them nice and slow.


## Absolute basics

We recommend these basics to help get in touch with computers. Especially, for absolute beginners, this is crucial, because after they learn these basics, they can already help others, at work, family members and so on.

- build a computer (use old components, at first)
    - build it, run it, dismantle it and build it again
    - get familiar with the components, so you have some visual idea what it means when someone says "stored in memory/disk", "processed by CPU", "send through network"
    - the idea is to understand what a personal computer means and to realize server is just a bigger, better personal computer
- install operating system, Windows and Linux, multiple times, get the hang of it
    - [Windows 10 installation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nbGkPYtXtmA){:target="_blank"}
    - [Rocky Linux installation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H5-EZiu4x_8){:target="_blank"}
- install tools like Sublime Text editor, Visual Studio Code, NodeJS, 7zip, Windows Terminal (or similar console)
- learn how to use directories - this is bread and butter, no way around it

    - [On Linux](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42iQKuQodW4){:target="_blank"}
  

Repeat those tasks over and over, until you are feel like you know what you are doing.

## Programming skills
