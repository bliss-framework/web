# Learning spiral

If we image that all knowledge about certain technology, language a library is a plane, where different aspects of it goes to different directions, as you can see on the example below, when you start with it, you are always in the middle.

![ASP.NET Core - Example of your knowledge about it](../assets/images/aspnet_core_star_diagram.png){ align=left }

You can always go only one direction, or perhaps two, but not more, and here lays the biggest problem. If you focus on one direction too much, you'll miss the rest of it.

That's why we learn in a spiral. We always start with the simplest thing possible, which is installation, and then we start collecting knowledge by small dips, here and there.

    Knowledge is like a bucket of ice cream you just pulled out of your freezer. If you try to scrape too much of it with your spoon, or you go too deep, it will be too hard, almost impossible to do. If you go slow and shallow, you get to enjoy some of the ice cream, while the rest starts melting down on you, after a while you can go deeper and deeper.

## Repetitio est mater studiorum

!!! note "Bruce Lee said" 
    I fear not the man who has practiced 10,000 kicks once, but I fear the man who has practiced one kick 10,000 times.

There is no way around it, until you repeat something 10s, 100s and even 1000s of times, it won't be truly stored in your brain.

We understand we live in the age of ChatGPT and Copilot, in times of easy code generation, it's almost like magic, but, in the end, you are just cheating yourself, you cannot learn something by watching someone else do it for you.

There is a silver lining in all of this, though. The more you repeat tasks in one technology, the easier is to learn another. Your brain will start to see patterns and similarities in different technologies, and with each technology it will be more simple and easier.

So buckle up, start with the basics, repeat them while always adding some small portion of something new.

An example of how to approach this:

    - create a Svelte application
    - delete it
    - create another Svelte application
    - delete it again
    - create yet another Svelte application
    - run it
    - delete it
    - create another Svelte application
      - at this point you start to wonder how to create them faster and start looking at the command line arguments
    - run it
    - see the outcome of build in your browser
    - change something in the generated page
    - check the outcome again
    - delete the app
    - start all over


This is the fastest way how get familiar with some technology, in spiral manner, and also create muscle memory that gives you confidence.


## Experience comes with time

Part of being a programmer is the rush of beating something complex, something hard to learn, something hard to program. This rush that comes from our ego is the main motivator of most programmers, the problem with it is, that it leads us on paths that are unnecessarily complicated and too hard to follow.

Another problem comes from our competitiveness, from measuring with others, usually much better programmers. This will not help you in any way. While seeing what is possible is certainly great, you cannot skip ahead of time.


The video below shows a furniture maker that built a marvelous workbench, it has all features possible, it's state of the art. It took this skilled furniture maker 2 months to build it.

Young inexperienced carpenter might be tempted to build this on his own. After all, what can be better, why bother with simple workbenches you can build from construction lumber, this is the masterpiece, this is the final destination, right? 

__Wrong.__

Even if he was able to build it, trust us, it's MUCH harder than it looks on video, it would take him so too much time and in the end, he would not be able to appreciate what he has built, he would lack the experience and reasons to build a better workbench like this one.

    You have to start with simple tools to be able to appreciate more complex ones.
