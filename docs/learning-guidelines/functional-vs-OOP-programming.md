# Functional vs Procedural vs OOP programming

As you might already know, or as you'll learn over the course of your career, there are three main groups of programming languages. 

- [functional languages](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_programming), represented, for example, by Rust, F#, Swift, Scala, and many others
- [procedural languages](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Procedural_programming), represented, for example, by C, Pascal and others
- [object-oriented languages](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-oriented_programming), represented, for example, by C#, Java, and many others

We won't cover every little aspect of these groups, there are better comparisons already out there. We'll just focus on the discussion which one should you use, and ultimately which one is the best.

## Types of programmers

There are basically three different types of languages explorers, programmers that don't stick to one language their whole life.

### Militant

Militant programmers are those that claims that one language approach (functional, procedural, OOP) is better than the others, and if you are not seeing it that way, use something else and don't bother them.

### Promiscuous

### Pragmatic
