# Basic principles

Beside our own experiences, we of course learn from others, and this is a list of basic principles we live by.

## Don't repeat yourself

The most important one is [Don't repeat yourself](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don%27t_repeat_yourself). We find this to truly define what we are and what our Bliss framework is about.

This principal says you should avoid repeating your code at multiple places. In all places, a single file, application, project or projects.

Why not to do it? It's quite simple, it generates and leads to errors, and it's more work to maintain.

We are quite militant about this. 

For example, when it comes to string constants in code, we don't allow ourselves to repeat it even once. We immediately put it in _Constants_ folder, where it belongs and in all other places use it as a reference.


## Protection of application by abstraction
