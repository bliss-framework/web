# Key elements of Bliss Framework

The principles and key elements you'll see in this framework are amalgamation and distilation of different approaches we've met and tried over the years.

We, as a company, also own a small restaurant and it surprised us how much these two types of operations have in common. 

Chefs and programmers do the same things

- they have to follow a recipe
- they take and return tools and ingredients from and to the same place
- they must keep their workplace clean
- they have to learn new approaches, new recipies,but they still have to customize them for their catering operation
- they have their own language, they have no time for miscommunication, for long debates what is what

## Understandibility

Since we have insight into gastro operations we realize we can describe our process with real life examples from restaurant, which is something even very new programmers can understand.

If the thing you do feels too complex to explain, it's probably overengineered and you should rethink your strategy.

## Nomenclature

Nomenclature, the naming of things, is super, super important. 
It makes the team faster in understanding what is what, and after a while it comes to you natural, it leads your way through code.

Our nomenclature is universal and not really dependent on the language or framework we use for our projects.
