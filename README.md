# Bliss Framework - Consistency is a bliss

This framework describes our approach to programming, life, and everything. It is intended to save you from mistakes we had to make to learn to survive in this crazy world of programming.

It doesn't cover all aspects of programming, because we are not Gods, but it covers enough to give you some work frame, hence the "framework" in Bliss Framework. :-)
